# Productions

## Production Line

A production line is a series of operations in a factory where items are transformed to get closer to their final state _"Finished Good"_. While the term production line is generally used for refinment processes, it englobe all types of lines within a factory. However, here are the differences between the lines we can retrieve within a factory.

* **Production Line**: The production line is normally the line where refinment process are used to create a part or a finished product.
* **Assembly Line**: The assembly line is where parts are assembled togheter.
* **Batch Line**: While the batch line is similar to the above one, it consist mainly of processing group of items each period. It is the opposite of a continuous line.

## Production Item

A production item is an item that is produced along the production line. Generally this item is a product that flows trough the production states _\(Pending, In Progress, Done\)_. While this item is normally made out of raw materials, we include them only when they reach the work in progress state, which is when the item enter productions. In short, it is a **group of stock** that represent a **futur** item to be produced.
