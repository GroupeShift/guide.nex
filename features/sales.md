## Invoicing
An invoice is the final result of an order where both the supplier and the buyer agree on the final price and pay the due. The invoices are always held and can never be updated. An invoice that needs any changes must be reverted and then re-invoiced to avoid any loss of track.

There are two status for the invoices, one being that the invoice is currently awaiting payment and the other one being that the invoice is paid. The client could also pay an invoice in multiple potion, therefore, multiple invoices with different numbers will be generated and attached to the same order.
